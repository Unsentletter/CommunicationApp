        Working through situations where we feel out of control takes time and
        practice. A good place to start might be to think about your calming
        strategies so you can calm your emotions before you try thinking about
        them.

        Talking to others about things when we are feeling like this is also
        really important. Would you like to let your parents know that you are
        ready to talk about this when you are home together?
